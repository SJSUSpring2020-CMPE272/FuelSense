#### Project Title
Fuel Type Predictive Analysis To Get The Best Fuel Economy For Automotive Industry
 
#### Project idea description 
The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards set by the Secretary of Transportation and EPA regulation requires all new automotive design to meet a certain fuel efficiency standard. In addition to this, the current automotive industry heavily relies on statistics such as fuel economy, servicing cost estimates to effectively market their product and to determine product feasibility for their future products. The project aims to create an application that will let the manufacturers analyze mileage for different types of fuels and road conditions. Utilizing Python ML libraries, the application will be able to set various parameters and predict the mileage for a fuel type. This will help the enterprise in marketing their products and get EPA approval with better ratings.

Project Title: Security bot
 
Project idea description: This will be a J2ME security based Mobile Application. It will allow users to escape from any troublesome situation. Situations, like if a user is attacked by any thief or if he watches any robbery incident in front of him/her. In that scenario, he needs to start or click the Security Bot Mobile App. Security Bot would automatically send the user's location and video clips of the incident to the Security Servers. Once a user starts the app, Security people will get a trigger and based on the GPS details and videos, it would be easy for them to locate the victim.
This is the initial idea of the project we can add more functionalities into the project.
Goal of the project: Safety of every individual.

Project Title: Contagious Diseases Predictor
 
Project idea description: The basic idea is to show how many patients/children have been diagnosed with contagious diseases over the years and to predict the same in future so that people will be more aware of the statistics and take these vaccinations seriously. The contagious diseases could be smallpox, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, rubella, hep A and we can build this at zip or state level.
